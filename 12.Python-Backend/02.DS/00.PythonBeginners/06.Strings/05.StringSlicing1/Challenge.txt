Challenge
Implement a function called get_substring(input_string: str, start: int, end: int) -> str. It takes a string and two integers as parameters, and returns the substring of input_string string from the start index to the end index (not including the end index).

Important: If end is an invalid index, return an empty string. You may assume that start will always be a valid index and that end will always be greater than or equal to start.

The last valid index for a slice is the length of the string. Remember that end is not included for a slice. The last character included will be at index end - 1.
