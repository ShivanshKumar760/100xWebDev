Challenge
Using this knowledge, implement the get_min(a: int, b: int) -> int function in the code editor. It should return the minimum of a and b. If they are equal, it doesn't matter which value you return.

Given Code:


def get_min(a: int, b: int) -> int:




    
# don't modify code below this line
print(get_min(10, 11))
print(get_min(5, -7))
print(get_min(20, 20))
