While Loops Counting
In the code editor, can you use a while loop to print the digits from 0 to 9 in order (including 0 and 9)? Your loop should execute 10 times.

The basic structure of a while loop in Python is shown below for your reference.

i = 0
while i < 5:
    print("I love Python!")
    i += 1
