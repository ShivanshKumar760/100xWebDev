One of the most common uses of a dictionary is to count the occurences of elements in a list. For example, given the list [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3], we can count the quantity of each element in the list using a dictionary.

The result would be a dictionary like this:

count = {
    1: 3,
    2: 3,
    3: 3
}
