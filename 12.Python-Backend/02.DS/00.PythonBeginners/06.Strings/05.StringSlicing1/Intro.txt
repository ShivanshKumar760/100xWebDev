String Slicing Part 1
If we only want to access a portion of a string we can use slicing. Slicing allows us to extract a substring from a string, by specifying a range of indices.

my_string = "Hello, World!"

start, end = 1, 5

print(my_string[start:end])  # Output: ello
In this example, we are extracting the substring from index 1 to 5 (not including 5) from the string "Hello, World!".
