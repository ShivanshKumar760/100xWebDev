What are the order of operations?
All logical operators have a specific order of operations. The order of operations for logical operators is NOT, AND, OR. This means that NOT is always performed first, then AND, and finally OR.

That said, as expressions grow larger, it's best to use parentheses to make the order of operations clear. This prevents unintended bugs and makes code more readable for others.
