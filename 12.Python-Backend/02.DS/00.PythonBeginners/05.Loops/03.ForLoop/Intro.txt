For Loops
There is a second way of looping in Python, using the for keyword. This is called a for loop.

i = 0
while i < 10:
    print(i)
    i += 1

for i in range(10):
    print(i)
The above two loops are equivalent. The first loop uses a while loop and the second loop uses a for loop. Both loops will print the numbers 0 through 9. You can see that the for loop is more concise and easier to read.

Let's explain the syntax of a for loop:

The loop starts with the keyword for.
Next, you need to specify a variable name. This variable will represent each item in the sequence. In the example above, we used the variable name i.
After the variable name, you need to use the keyword in.
Finally, you need to specify the sequence you want to iterate over. In the example above, we used the function range(10). This function generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to 9. 10 is not included in the sequence.
