Return Statement
Functions are even more extensible then they seem. Instead of just printing a value, you can also return a value from a function. This allows you to use the result of a function in other parts of your code, outside of the original function.

def add(x, y):
    return x + y

result = add(3, 5)
print(result)  # This will print 8
