What about order of operations?
I'm glad you asked! The order of operations in Python is the same as in mathematics. The acronym PEMDAS can help you remember the order:

Parentheses
Exponents
Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)
For example, in the expression 2 + 3 * 4, the multiplication is done first, then the addition. The result is 14.

To specify the order of operations, you can use parentheses. For example, (2 + 3) * 4 will result in 20.
