A script is a file that contains a series of commands that are executed by a computer. Scripts are often used to automate repetitive tasks, such as renaming files, moving files, or processing data. Python is often used to write scripts because of its simplicity and readability.

Technically, any program that is written in a scripting language is a script. However, the term is often used to refer to small programs that automate tasks on a computer. The terms "scripting language" and "interpreted language" are often used interchangeably. They are technically different, but the distinction is rarely important.
