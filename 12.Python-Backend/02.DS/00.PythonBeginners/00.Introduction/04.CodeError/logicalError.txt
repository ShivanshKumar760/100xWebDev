A logical error is an error that occurs when the program runs without crashing or 
producing an error, but the output is not what the programmer intended. 
This is commonly known as a bug. Logical errors can be difficult to find because as 
programmers we have to identify which lines of code are causing the incorrect output. 
There are various techniques to debug logical errors, but in large programs, it can 
still be very challenging.
