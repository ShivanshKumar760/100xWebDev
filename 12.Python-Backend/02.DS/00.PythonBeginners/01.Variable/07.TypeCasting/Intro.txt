Type Casting
A variable in Python can be converted to a different type using type casting. 
For example, the following code will run without any errors:

variable = 10.9
print(int(variable))
This code will output:

10
The variable variable is a floating-point number. The int() function converts it to an integer. 
The output is the integer part of the floating-point number, aka rounding the number down.
