A runtime error is an error that occurs while the program is running. That means the syntax 
of the program itself is fine. It is usually caused by something that the programmer 
did not anticipate. Runtime errors can be difficult to debug because they may not always 
occur consistently. For example, if 
we programmed a calculator and the user tries to 
divide by zero, we will get a runtime error.
