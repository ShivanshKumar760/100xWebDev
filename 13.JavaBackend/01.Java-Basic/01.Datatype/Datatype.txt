Data type are declaration for variables .This determines the type and size of data associated with variables which is essential
to know since different data types occupy different sizes of memory .

There are 2 types of data types :
1.Primitive Data types :to store simple values
2.Non Primitive Data types:to store complex values


Primitive Data type:

These are the data type of fixed size 

Data type      Meaning      size(in bytes)   Range 

byte           8 bit signed     1            -128 to 127

short          16 bit signed    2            -32,768 to 32,767

int            32 bit signed    4            -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647


long           64 bit signed    8            -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 
                                              9,223,373,036,854,775,807

float          32 bit IEEE 754  4             upto 7 decimal
               floating point 


double         64 bit IEEE 754  8             upto 16 decimal
               floating 
               point 

char           unicode character 2             a,b,c.....
               (16 bit)

bool          boolean            1             true and false     
  


Non Primitive Data type
These are of variable size and are usually declared with a 'new' keyword


Ex:String,Array


String name=new String("Aman");
int [] marks = new int[3];
marks[0]=97;
marks[1]=98;
marks[2]=95;
