Variable Naming
Previously we named our string variable message. 
The name of a variable is how we can refer to it in our code. 
This means we can't have two different variables with the same name.

If we wanted a variable to store the capital of the United Kingdom, 
we could name it capital_of_uk. This is a good name because it is descriptive and 
easy to understand.

capital_of_uk = "London"
print(capital_of_uk)
Output:

London
There are some strict rules for naming variables, if you break any of these rules it will cause an error:

Variable names can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
Variable names can't start with a number.
Variable names can't contain spaces.
Variable names can't be the same as Python keywords like for, if, (we will learn more about these later).
