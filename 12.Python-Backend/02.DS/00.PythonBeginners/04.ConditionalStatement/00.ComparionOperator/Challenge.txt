Challenge
Implement the six functions defined in the code editor.

check_equal(x, y) should return whether x is equal to y.
check_not_equal(x, y) should return whether x is not equal to y.
check_less_than(x, y) should return whether x is less than y.
check_greater_than(x, y) should return whether x is greater than y.
check_less_than_or_equal(x, y) should return whether x is less than or equal to y.
check_greater_than_or_equal(x, y) should return whether x is greater than or equal to y.
You may assume your functions will only receive integers as input.


Given Code:
def check_equal(x, y) -> bool:


def check_not_equal(x, y) -> bool:


def check_less_than(x, y) -> bool:


def check_greater_than(x, y) -> bool:


def check_less_than_or_equal(x, y) -> bool:


def check_greater_than_or_equal(x, y) -> bool:


# Don't change below this line
print("2 is equal to 2:", check_equal(2, 2))
print("-2 is equal to 2:", check_equal(-2, 2))

print("-2 is not equal to 2:", check_not_equal(-2, 2))
print("2 is not equal to 2:", check_not_equal(2, 2))
