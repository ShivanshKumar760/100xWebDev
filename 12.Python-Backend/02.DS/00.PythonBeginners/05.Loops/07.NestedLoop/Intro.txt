Nested Loops
Suppose we wanted to print all possible pairs from the following set of integers 1, 2, 3, where the order of the pairs matters. This would look like:

1,1	1,2	1,3
2,1	2,2	2,3
3,1	3,2	3,3
This can be accomplished by placing a loop inside of another loop. This is called a nested loop.

for i in range(1, 4):
    for j in range(1, 4):
        print(i, j)
1 1
1 2
1 3
2 1
2 2
2 3
3 1
3 2
3 3
A few things to notice:

Remember loops do not create their own scope. So we must use different variable names for the nested loops.
The inner loop must be indented to show that it is inside the outer loop.
We are printing two variables at the same time, which is why we place a comma between them. This means that each value is a separate argument to the print function.
The outer loop will run 3 times total.
The inner loop will run 3 times, for each iteration of the outer loop. This will result in the print statement being executed 9 times. The inner loop will run to completion before the outer loop continues.
