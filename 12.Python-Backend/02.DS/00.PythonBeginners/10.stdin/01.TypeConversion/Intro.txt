Type Conversion with Input
We are not required to provide a prompt to the user when calling the input() function:

user_input = input() # This will read one line of input from stdin

print(user_input) # This will print the input to the console
By default, input() returns the user input as a string. If you're expecting a different type of input like an integer or a float, you need to explicitly convert it using int() or float().

age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

temperature = float(input("Enter the temperature: "))
The example above converts the user input, which is expected to be an integer representing age, to an integer using int(). It also converts the user input, which is expected to be a float representing temperature, to a float using float(). It's important to note that if the user enters a value that can't be converted to the expected type, a ValueError will be raised, so be careful when converting user input.
