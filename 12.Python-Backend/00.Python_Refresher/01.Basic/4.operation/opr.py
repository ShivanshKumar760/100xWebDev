#Now in python we have set of mathematical operation as well as logical operation 
#In this module we will focus on mathematical opetation


num1=8
num2=2

print("Number 1 is :",num1)

#addition:

print("Addition of two will be  :",num1+num2)

#subtraction

print("Subtraction of two number will be  :",num1-num2)

#multiplication

print("Multiplication of two number will be ",num1*num2)

#division

print("Division of two number will be ",num1/num2)

#modulos or remainder

print(f"Remainder after dividing  {num1} with {num2} will be :{num1%num2}")


#Exponential / Power

print(f"Result of  {num1} to the power of {num2} will be :{num1**num2}")
