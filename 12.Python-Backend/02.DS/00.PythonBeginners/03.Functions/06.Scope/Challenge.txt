Challenge
To prove that the variable n inside the function is different than the one outside, consider this code:

def add_one(n):
    n = n + 1
    print(n)   

n = 10

add_one(n)     # Output: 11

print(n)       # Output: ?
What do you think the output of the last print statement will be? Will it be 10 or 11? Run the code in the editor to find out.
