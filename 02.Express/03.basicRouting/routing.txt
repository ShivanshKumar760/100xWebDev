A backend routing plug-in is used to route API requests to different backend service URLs 
by changing the backend service type, URL, path, and parameters in the requests

Routing in backend development is a technology that allows a back-end app to switch 
between different server-side endpoints based on the requested URL. Many front-end and back-end frameworks use routing internally to invoke 
different functionality based on the URL and its components


Example like google backend provide multiple service like mail,meet,classroom
each service is accessible through routing where we hit the google sever 
which is mapped with google.com domain

so www.google.com/endpoint<service>

we we want to use a mail or gmail service we will route our backend to swtich 
from google main  engine to mailing ending 

www.google.com/gmail

route:/gmail
endpoint:gmail
