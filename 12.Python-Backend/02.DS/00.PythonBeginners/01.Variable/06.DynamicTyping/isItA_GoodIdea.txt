Dynamic typing should generally be avoided when possible. 
This means you should avoid changing a variable's type throughout your code. 
If you do, you may not know what type a variable is at any given time, which can lead to 
bugs and make your code harder to understand.

Static typing is employed by many languages on purpose. It can help catch errors early, 
make code easier to read, and improve performance.

Each typing system has it's own advantages and disadvantages. Dynamic typing is 
flexible, but can be error-prone. Static typing is safer, but can be inflexible.
