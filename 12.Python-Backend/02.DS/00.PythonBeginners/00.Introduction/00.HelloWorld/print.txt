In Python, print() is a built-in function used to display output to the console. 
We will learn more about functions later on in the course. 
For now you can use it to print text, variables, or the result of expressions 
to the console.

Most programming languages have the equivalent of print() to display output. 
For example, in JavaScript, you would use console.log().

The console is a text-based interface that allows you to interact with a computer. 
It is a common tool used by developers to debug their code. In this course, we are actually executing your code on our own server and sending the console output back to you.
