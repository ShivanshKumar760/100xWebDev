Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more.

Addition +: Adds two operands together.
Subtraction -: Subtracts the second operand from the first.
Multiplication *: Multiplies two operands.
Division /: Divides the first operand by the second. The result is always a float.
x, y = 3, 6

print(x + y) # Output: 9

print(x - y) # Output: -3

print(x * y) # Output: 18

print(x / y) # Output: 0.5
If we divide y by x, the result will be 2.0 and not 2. This is because the result of division is always a float in Python.


For the other arithmetic operators, the result will be an integer if both operands are integers. If one of the operands is a float, the result will be a float.
