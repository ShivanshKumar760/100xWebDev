urlencoded means
URL-encoded refers to the process of converting characters into a format that 
can be safely transmitted over the Internet. It encodes special characters as a 
series of percent signs and hexadecimal digits to ensure data is passed accurately
without misinterpretation. For example, a space is represented as %20


When a form is URL-encoded, the data from the form is converted into a string of 
key-value pairs, which are then encoded into a format that can be sent over the internet. 
Each key-value pair is separated by an ampersand (&), and within each pair, the key and 
value are separated by an equals sign (=). Special characters are encoded using 
percent-encoding.

For example, if a form has fields for name and age, with values John Doe and 25, 
respectively, the URL-encoded string might look like this:

name=John%20Doe&age=25
