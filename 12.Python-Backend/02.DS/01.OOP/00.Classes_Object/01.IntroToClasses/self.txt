n Python, self represents the instance of the class. 
It's used to access variables and methods associated with the class. 
When you create an object from a class, 
Python automatically passes the object as the first argument to the __init__ method. 
You can name this argument anything you like, but self is the convention.

Don't worry if this doesn't make sense right now. We'll cover it in more detail in the 
upcoming lessons.
