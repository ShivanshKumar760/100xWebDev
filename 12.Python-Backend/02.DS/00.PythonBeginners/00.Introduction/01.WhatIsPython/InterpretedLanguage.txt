An interpreted programming language is different from a compiled language. 
In a compiled language, the code is translated into machine code before it is 
run. In an interpreted language, the code is executed line by line by an 
interpreter, usually written in another language. 
This makes it easier to write and test code, but it can be slower than 
compiled languages.

It's okay if you don't understand all of this yet.
If you're a beginner learning Python as your first language, the distinction between 
interpreted and compiled languages is not important for now.
