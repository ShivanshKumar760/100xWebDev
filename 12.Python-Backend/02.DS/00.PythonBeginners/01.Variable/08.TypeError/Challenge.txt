Challenge
The code on the right will currently throw an error (you can run it to confirm). Can you find the bug and fix it so the output is:

10
<class 'str'>
10
<class 'int'>


Given Code :


variable = "hello"

# Don't modify the code below this line
print(variable)
print(type(variable))

variable = int(variable)

print(variable)
print(type(variable))
