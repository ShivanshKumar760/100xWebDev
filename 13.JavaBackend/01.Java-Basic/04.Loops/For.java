         * A loop is a programming construct that repeats a block of code a certain number of times
         * or until a specific condition is met.
         * There are several types of loops in Java, including:
         * 1. for loop: Used when the number of iterations is known beforehand.
         * 2. while loop: Used when the number of iterations is not known beforehand.
         * 3. do-while loop: Similar to the while loop, but guarantees at least one iteration.
         * 4. enhanced for loop: Used to iterate over arrays and collections.
