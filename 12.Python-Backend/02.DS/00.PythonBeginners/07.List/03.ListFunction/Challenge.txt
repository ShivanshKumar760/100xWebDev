Challenge
Implement the following functions on the right:

get_sum(my_list: List[int]) -> int should return the sum of all the elements in the list.
get_min(my_list: List[int]) -> int should return the smallest element in the list.
get_max(my_list: List[int]) -> int should return the largest element in the list.
You may assume the list passed in will always have at least one element.

If you want a challenge, try to implement these functions without using the built-in sum(), min(), and max() functions. Instead, you can use a loop to iterate through the list and keep track of the sum, minimum, and maximum.

Hint: It's generally not wise to name variables sum, min, or max since these are built-in functions. If you do, you will overwrite the built-in functions and won't be able to use them anymore.
