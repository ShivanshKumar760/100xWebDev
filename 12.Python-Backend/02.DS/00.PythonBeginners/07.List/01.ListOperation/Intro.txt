List Operations
Lists can also be used within conditional statements. For example, we can check if a list is empty or not:

my_list = [1, 2, 3]

if len(my_list) > 0:
    print("The list is not empty")
else:
    print("The list is empty")

if my_list:
    print("The list is not empty")
else:
    print("The list is empty")

The above two conditional statements are equivalent. The second one is more concise and is generally preferred.

We can also use the in operator to check if an element is present in a list:

my_list = [1, 2, 3]

if 2 in my_list:
    print("2 is in the list")
else:
    print("2 is not in the list")

    
If we want to check if an element is not in the list, we can use the not in operator:

my_list = [1, 2, 3]

if 4 not in my_list:
    print("4 is not in the list")
else:
    print("4 is in the list")
