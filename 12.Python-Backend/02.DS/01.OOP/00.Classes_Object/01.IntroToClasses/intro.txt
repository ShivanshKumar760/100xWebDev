Intro to Classes
Solved 
Imagine you're a game developer creating a superhero game. You start by defining individual heroes:

hero_1_name = "Iron Man"
hero_1_power = "repulsor beams"
hero_1_health = 100
hero_1_speed = 80

hero_2_name = "Spider Man"
hero_2_power = "web slinging"
hero_2_health = 90
hero_2_speed = 95
This approach has a few problems:

Repetition: You have to define each hero individually.
Messy code: It's hard to keep track of all the hero attributes and their values.
Scalability: What if you need to create 50 different heroes? Your code would become unmanageable very quickly.

Classes
A class is a blueprint for creating objects. Here's the basic syntax for defining a class in Python:

class SuperHero:
    def __init__(self, name: str, power: str, health: int, speed: int):
        self.name = name
        self.power = power
        self.health = health
        self.speed = speed
In Python, a class is defined with the keyword word class followed by the name of the class and a colon. The __init__ method is a special method that belongs to the class. It creates an object and initializes it's attributes.

Notice that the __init__ method has an argument self. This is required. The self variable allows us to add attributes to our object. It also prevents name conflicts, since name and self.name are different variables.

Challenge
Please see the starter code on the right and complete the following tasks:

Define a class named Pet.
Define a method for initialization: def __init__(self, name, species)
Inside the __init__ method, initialize two attributes:
self.name: assigned the value of the name parameter
self.species: assigned the value of the species parameter
