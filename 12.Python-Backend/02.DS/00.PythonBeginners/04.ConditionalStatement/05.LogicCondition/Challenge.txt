Challenge
Implement the discount_applies(age: int) -> bool 
function. It accepts an integer age and should 
return True if the age is less than 18, or the 
age is greater than or equal to 65. Otherwise, 
it should return False.



Given code is :
def discount_applies(age: int) -> bool:




# don't modify this code below this line
print(discount_applies(17))
print(discount_applies(18))
print(discount_applies(40))
print(discount_applies(65))
print(discount_applies(70))
