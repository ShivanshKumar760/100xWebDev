Reading Input Practice
Implement the function add_two_numbers() -> int. It doesn't have any parameters because you will be reading from stdin. The function should read one line from stdin, which contains two integers separated by a comma. The function should return the sum of the two integers.

The stdin to your program will be:

1,2
3,4
10,25
1032,1272
