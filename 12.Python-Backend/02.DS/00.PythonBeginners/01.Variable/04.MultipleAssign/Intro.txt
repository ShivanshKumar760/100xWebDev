Multiple Assignments
Python allows you to assign multiple variables in a single line. Just separate the variables with a comma, and the right-hand side values with a comma as well.

[msg1, msg2 = "Hello", "World"]
is equivalent to:

msg1 = "Hello"
msg2 = "World"

This example shows two variables being assigned values in one line, but we can assign more than two if we want.

We can also use this to swap the values of variables:

msg1, msg2 = "Hello", "World" # msg1 = "Hello", msg2 = "World"
msg1, msg2 = msg2, msg1       # msg1 = "World", msg2 = "Hello"
