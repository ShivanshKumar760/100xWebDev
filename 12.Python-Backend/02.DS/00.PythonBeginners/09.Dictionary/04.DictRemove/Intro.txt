Dict Remove
You can remove an item from a dictionary using the pop() function. This function takes a key as an argument and removes the key-value pair from the dictionary. If the key doesn't exist, it will raise a KeyError.

my_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}

my_dict.pop("a")

print(my_dict) # Output: {"b": 2, "c": 3}

my_dict.pop("d") # Raises KeyError
If you don't want to worry about handling the KeyError, you can use the second argument of the pop() function. This argument is the default value that will be returned if the key doesn't exist.

my_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}

value = my_dict.pop("d", 0) # Returns 0, no error occurs
You can also use the del keyword to remove a key-value pair from a dictionary. This is a bit more concise than using the pop() function.

my_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}

del my_dict["a"]
