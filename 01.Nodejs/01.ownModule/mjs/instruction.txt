ECMAScript Modules (MJS)
Definition: ECMAScript Modules (ESM) is the official module format introduced 
in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015). It allows for the use of import and export statements to 
manage module functionalities.

Syntax:

Importing:
import { myFunction } from './myModule.mjs';


Exporting:

export const myFunction = () => { /*...*/ };

Usage: ESM is designed to work in both browser and server environments,
supporting asynchronous loading of modules. This allows for better performance 
in web applications where modules can be loaded in parallel.

File Extension: ECMAScript modules typically use the .mjs extension or can 
also be specified in .js files if the type is set to module in the package.json.

So if we are not using package.json to specify the file type in order for us to import 
and export we have to actually use the extension of .mjs
