List Looping
We can also loop through lists similar to how we loop through strings.

By using the length of the list:

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

length = len(my_list)

for i in range(length):
    print(my_list[i])
Or by using the in operator:

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

for element in my_list:
    print(element)
Both of these methods will print each element of the list on a separate line. If we don't need the index of the element, the second method is generally preferred since it is more concise.
