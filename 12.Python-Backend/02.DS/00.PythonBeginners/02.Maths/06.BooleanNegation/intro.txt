Boolean Negation
There is yet another keyword in Python, called not, that is used to perform a logical NOT operation, also known as negation.

It's the simplest of the three logical operators. It simply inverts the value of the operand. If the operand is True, the result is False. If the operand is False, the result is True.

a = True
b = False
print(not a)  # Output: False
print(not b)  # Output: True
We can also use the operators in combination. For example, we can negate the result of an AND operation:

a, b = True, False
print(not (a and b))  # Output: True
First the AND operation is performed, which results in False. Then the NOT operation is performed on the result, which results in True.
