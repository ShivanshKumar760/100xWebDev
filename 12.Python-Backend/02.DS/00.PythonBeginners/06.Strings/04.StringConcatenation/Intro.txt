String Concatenation
In Python, concatenation is the process of combining two or more strings into a single string. Python provides the + operator for concatenating strings. When you use the + operator with two strings, Python joins them together to create a new string.

str1 = "Hello, "
str2 = "world!"
print(str1 + str2) # Output: Hello, world!
In this example, str1 and str2 are concatenated together using the + operator, resulting in the string "Hello, world!".
