In Python, indentation is used to define code blocks. 
All code that belongs to a function should be indented. 
The standard convention is to use 4 spaces for indentation, 
which is what we are following in this course. Sometimes code is only indented by 2 spaces, 
but this is less common. Either way, it's important to be consistent with your indentation. 
This is the only way Python knows what code belongs to a function.
