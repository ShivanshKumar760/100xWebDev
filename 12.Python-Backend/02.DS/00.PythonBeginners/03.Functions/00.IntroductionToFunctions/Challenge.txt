Challenge
In the code editor, we are calling two functions, greet() and say_goodbye().

The greet() function is already defined but it has a bug. It should print "Hello, World!".
The say_goodbye() function is not defined. Define it so that it prints "Goodbye, World!".



Given Code:
def greet():
print("Hello, World!")



# don't modify below this line
greet()
say_goodbye()
