So when a client sends a get request the response client gets is a read-only response
that's client cannot manipulated data onto the server with get request 

like with post method we can manipulate the database by creating new object based 
on client posted data 

but sometimes client may want to recive a data in a certain way suppose given a list
of user client only wants data in a sorted manner that they should be sorted in ascending
order of there name or decending order of ther name

so client can only send get request but it's upto us programmer to hnadle
that get request and handle it on server and response with the client required
data 

Now but as a programmer we need a way to find out in which manner does the 
client need's the data to be sorted that is ascending or decending and for that we 
use query-parameter 

there are key and value pair initiated with question mark(?)

suppose we have url www.example.com/user?id=1

here id is a query parameter with value 1 which basically here in above url mean
from www.example.com get me user with id=1

so if we need to know as a developer what kind of sorting user/clinet want now either 
we can genrate a form to get user input but but building just a form for sorting is 
not optimal and as a sepration of concern form should be used only with post method

so here we can use query parameter to pass additional info so that server can 
process response:


localhost:3000/getUser?sort=asc or localhost:3000/getUser>sort=dsc


we can ever use query parameter to pass data to post method route but again since query parameter
are sent by browser and they are not binded with post or get method like a form does so we 
will need a api tool to fire up the endpoint with post request and query


A query parameter is a key-value pair that is added to the end of a URL to provide extra 
information to a web server when making requests. They are a vital part of the URL and 
are used to define specific actions or content based on the data that is being passed. 



The query component is indicated by the first ? in a URI. "Query string" might be a 
synonym (this term is not used in the URI standard).

Some examples for HTTP URIs with query components:

http://example.com/foo?bar
http://example.com/foo/foo/foo?bar/bar/bar
http://example.com/?bar
http://example.com/?@bar._=???/1:
http://example.com/?bar1=a&bar2=b




Both are the ways of passing data in GET/POST and other requests. 
Below are some differences.

(Route or Path) Parameters:
https://localhost:3000/user/5896544

access from backend: request.params.userId = 5896544

(Query or URL Query or Query String) Parameters:
https://localhost:3000/user?userId=5896544

access from backend: request.query.userId = 5896544
